# Steno-Key

## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to the Steno-Key project! This is a custom project that I've wanted to make for a while because I've always been fascinated by stenography keyboards and the high WPMs that people can achieve with it. This README serves as an introduction to stenography keyboards, the design process with making one from scratch, and eventually a demonstration of the keyboard working.

## 🛠️ Design Approach

We will use the STM32F103 chip as the main microcontroller that handles the inputs from the Cherry switches, and we will write some firmware to handle those key inputs. More specifically, we will use the `QMK` library since they already have a built-in stenography library.
